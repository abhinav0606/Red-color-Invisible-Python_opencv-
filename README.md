# Red-color-Invisible-Python_opencv-
The thing is like Green Screen(Here the color is red)....................................
Here when the red color will come into the frame it will get invisible and the thing which is covered by that red sheet will also get invisible.So we will store the background for some seconds 
and when the red sheet will come the background will be seen rather than something else
